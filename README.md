# GishushuTraffic_Light23394
The Gishushu Traffic Lights State Machine manages traffic flow at the Gishushu intersection, ensuring safety and efficiency for both vehicles and pedestrians. The system operates through a series of states, including North-South Green Phase, North-South Yellow Phase, East-West Green Phase, East-West Yellow Phase, and All Red Phase. The system operates cyclically, allowing vehicles to move in the north-south direction while pedestrians cross east-west. Each green phase is followed by a yellow phase to alert drivers to stop, and an all-red phase briefly between each green phase to clear the intersection.
